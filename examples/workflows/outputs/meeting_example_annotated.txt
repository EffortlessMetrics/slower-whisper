Sarah, do you want to go first and share what you've been working on?

[00:12 - 00:18]
Sure! I finished the authentication module yesterday and it's ready for review.

[00:19 - 00:24]
That's great news. Any blockers or issues we should know about?
  >> Pitch: medium (flat) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: focused (72%)

[00:25 - 00:35]
Well, I'm a little concerned about the API rate limiting... we might need to discuss that with the backend team.
  >> Pitch: low (falling) | Energy: quiet | Speech: slow pace | Pauses: 2 | Emotion: concerned (76%)

[00:36 - 00:42]
Good catch. I'll set up a meeting with them for this afternoon.
  >> Pitch: medium (rising) | Energy: moderate | Speech: fast pace | Emotion: decisive (81%)

Thanks! Other than that, I'm moving on to the dashboard components today. Should have the first iteration done by end of week.

[00:53 - 00:58]
Perfect. Mike, how about you? What's your status?
  >> Pitch: medium (flat) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: neutral (70%)

I've been working on the database optimization... but honestly, I'm running into some performance issues I wasn't expecting.
  >> Pitch: low (flat) | Energy: quiet | Speech: slow pace | Pauses: 3 | Emotion: uncertain (73%)

[01:09 - 01:15]
Hmm, that doesn't sound good. Can you elaborate on what kind of issues?
  >> Pitch: low (falling) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: concerned (68%)

[01:16 - 01:28]
The query times are way longer than they should be, even with indexing. I think we might need to reconsider the schema design for the analytics tables.
  >> Pitch: medium (flat) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: analytical (77%)

[01:29 - 01:35]
Okay, that's important. Let's make that a priority. Do you need help from anyone?

Yeah, if someone could pair with me on this, that would be really helpful.

I can jump in after lunch if that works for you.

Now, one more thing before we wrap up. The product team wants us to prioritize the mobile responsive design for the next sprint.
  >> Pitch: medium (flat) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: informative (74%)

[02:11 - 02:16]
Wait, I thought we agreed last week that API improvements were the priority?
  >> Pitch: high (rising) | Energy: loud | Speech: fast pace | Emotion: surprised (79%)

[02:17 - 02:25]
I know, but they got feedback from a major client yesterday, and mobile is becoming critical for them.
  >> Pitch: medium (flat) | Energy: moderate | Speech: normal pace | Emotion: explanatory (72%)

[02:26 - 02:32]
I see. Well, we'll need to adjust our estimates then. That's a pretty big change.
