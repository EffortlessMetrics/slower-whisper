## Usage

These examples serve multiple purposes:

1. **Preview**: See what outputs look like before running workflows
2. **Template**: Understand the structure for building custom reports
3. **Documentation**: Reference for explaining outputs to stakeholders
4. **Testing**: Validate your workflow configurations produce similar results

## Notes on Synthetic Data

All data in these examples is synthetic and sanitized:

- Names are fictional
- Content is generic and illustrative
- Timestamps and metrics are representative but not from real sessions
- Emotional scores are plausible but fabricated
- No real personal or proprietary information is included

When you run the workflows on your own data, you'll see:
- Real timestamps from your audio
- Actual transcribed text
- Genuine emotional and prosodic features
- True quality metrics

## Customization

All workflows support customization:

- Modify templates to change report formats
- Adjust thresholds to tune detection sensitivity
- Configure output formats (TXT, CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Add custom metadata fields
- Change scoring algorithms

See the configuration files in `../configs/` for examples.
