## Update Schedule

These statistics should be regenerated:
- **Monthly:** During regular maintenance cycles
- **Before Releases:** To track progress and validate quality
- **After Major Changes:** When significant features are added or refactored

## Regeneration

To regenerate these statistics, run:

```bash
# This will analyze the codebase and generate fresh statistics
# (Add your regeneration command here when automated)
```

Or request a manual analysis from Claude Code:
```

## Contributing

When adding new code:
1. Maintain docstring coverage (>95%)
2. Add tests for new modules (100% module coverage)
3. Update examples when adding features
4. Document significant changes

These practices ensure the statistics remain positive and the codebase maintainable.
