## 2026-01-25 - Destructive Action Confirmation
**Learning:** Destructive actions (like clearing cache) require distinct visual warnings. Plain text warnings are often missed.
**Action:** Use `Colors.red()` for critical warnings like "This cannot be undone." inside interactive prompts to enforce attention.

## 2026-01-26 - Atomic Pre-flight Checks
**Learning:** For bulk file operations (like copying samples), users prefer a "check-then-act" model where all conflicts are reported upfront, rather than failing on the first conflict.
**Action:** Implement pre-flight checks that gather *all* conflicts and raise a custom error (like `SampleExistsError`) containing the full list, allowing the CLI to present a complete summary before asking for confirmation.

## 2026-01-27 - API Documentation UX
**Learning:** API Documentation (like Swagger/Redoc) is a critical User Interface for developers. Grouping endpoints with descriptive tags significantly reduces cognitive load when exploring a new API.
**Action:** Always provide `tags_metadata` in FastAPI applications to give context to endpoint groups, rather than relying on default behaviors.
